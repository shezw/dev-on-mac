### nginx default config & notice

```bash
Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To start nginx now and restart at login:
brew services start nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
/usr/local/opt/nginx/bin/nginx -g daemon\ off\;

```
